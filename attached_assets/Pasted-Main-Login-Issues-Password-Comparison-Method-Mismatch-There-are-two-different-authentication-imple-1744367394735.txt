Main Login Issues

Password Comparison Method Mismatch:
There are two different authentication implementations in your codebase (auth.ts and simple-auth.ts), but they handle password comparison differently. In simple-auth.ts (which seems to be the one you're using), there's a comment indicating it's just doing plain text password comparison, but the implementation doesn't actually check passwords correctly.
Inconsistent Password Storage:
In some places, the code is storing hashed passwords, and in others, it's storing plain text passwords. This inconsistency could be causing authentication to fail.
Multiple Auth Configurations:
Your application has multiple authentication configurations that might be conflicting with each other.

Specific Implementation Issues

In simple-auth.ts, the LocalStrategy doesn't actually compare the passwords:

typescript// It gets the user and logs the passwords but doesn't compare them
console.log(`- Provided password: ${password}`);
console.log(`- Stored password in DB: ${user.password}`);
// And then immediately returns success
return done(null, user);

In the mock data initialization in storage.ts, you're trying to create a test user with a hashed password that might not match what's expected by the auth system.

Potential Fix
The simplest fix would be to modify the LocalStrategy in simple-auth.ts to actually compare passwords. Since this appears to be a development environment, you could just do a direct comparison:
typescriptif (password === user.password) {
  return done(null, user);
} else {
  console.log('Password mismatch');
  return done(null, false);
}
Or to implement the same test user creation logic from /api/dev/create-test-user endpoint, which appears to store passwords in plain text for testing purposes.
Steps to Fix

Try visiting the endpoint /api/dev/create-test-user in your browser first. This should create a test user with the username "azure_test_user" and password "Azure123!".
Then try logging in with those credentials.
If that doesn't work, you may need to modify the simple-auth.ts file to properly compare passwords as suggested above.
